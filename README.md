Can robots play music you like? http://www.fastcolabs.com/3029276/can-robot-musicians-play-songs-that-entrance-human-ears … - can computers evolve music you like? My friend Michael Bauer (aka @mihi-tr)‎hopes so! And he told @rebekahmonson @ericcades and me about his great idea of using sensors to identify what type of music people like more in the dancefloor. All of this during a Chicas Poderosas Miami event (http://www.meetup.com/Chicas-Poderosas/events/170403192/). 

Hence: Sensor Party Music Project... a evolving brainstorm on how to use sensors to create the ultimate dance music experience in a Sensor Party near you. 

Join me on getting @mihi-tr to pursue this crazy awesome idea and help him if you want to :)
