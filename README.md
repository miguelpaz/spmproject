# Sensor Party Music Project 

Can robots play music you like? http://www.fastcolabs.com/3029276/can-robot-musicians-play-songs-that-entrance-human-ears â€¦ - can computers evolve music you like? My friend Michael Bauer (aka @mihi-tr) hopes so! And he told @rebekahmonson @ericcades and me about his great idea of using sensors to identify what type of music people like more in the dancefloor. All of this during a Chicas Poderosas Miami event (http://www.meetup.com/Chicas-Poderosas/events/170403192/). 

Hence: Sensor Party Music Project... a evolving brainstorm on how to use sensors to create the ultimate dance music experience in a Sensor Party near you. 

Join me on getting @mihi-tr to pursue this crazy awesome idea and help him if you want to :)

Update april 23, 2014: As you can see below, @mihi-tr started to work on the idea. You can join, too. 

## The Idea

Genetic algorithms are fantastic - based on scoring mechanisms they are
able to create something you would never have thought of. This works for
strategies for performing tasks, design of objects and many more areas.
Does it work for dance music? We hope so.

Imagine a party where you arrive, put on a sensor (or start an app on your
phone) and listen to quite experimental music. You might start to dance a
bit at one point and the music becomes more and more dancable - still very
experimental though. After a few hours it still will be quite experimental
but good and danceable. Machines learned what makes good dance music and
generate it. 

Every party will be different - based on mutations and randomness. Unique
but thrilling.

## How we can build it

Work on Genetic Algorithms to produce music - ideally using something like
Processing or OpenFrameworks (the latter can also be used to read in the
sensor)

Then figure out how to do sensors - use mobile phones with an app that
reads the accelerometers. This can help us getting off cheap. Otherwise
create wrist-bands that radio in the movements. 

Connect the two / test+iterate: Win!

## Be Part of it!

The Sensor Party Music Project is a creative, collaborative effort. Just as
we collaboratively want to create music on the event you can be part of
this.

How:

* Contribute Code - Fork us on Github and figure out how to do parts
* Share your ideas: In issues or on the wiki!
* Test and review what is already there.
