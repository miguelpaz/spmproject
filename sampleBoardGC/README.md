# Sample Board README

This is a very simple button board to play sound samples. Click on a button
to make the sample play. The rows are different samples (loaded from
data/samples.txt).

To use in this configuration download the
[Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra](http://sso.mattiaswestlund.net/) Sample set
and copy the ```Samples/``` subfolder into ```bin/data```

Tested on Linux - have fun!
